Note: We use google chart API to create QR codes for required text or url

*** The Google Chart API is an interactive Web service (now deprecated) that creates graphical charts 
from user-supplied data. Google servers create a PNG image of a chart from data and formatting parameters 
specified by a user's HTTP request. The service supports a wide variety of chart information and formatting.
